# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
Project to collect, work with, and clean a data set

#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

#1# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#5# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# From Readme 
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
